Figure generation
=================

* The main scripts are

  * `figure_rmse.py` to generate the RMSE plots for the test models,
  * `figure_fits_and_weights.py` to generate the data fit and weights plots
    for the test models,
  * `figure_tumor_kdes.py` to generate the tumor model kernel density
    estimate plots,
  * `figure_tumor_fits_and_weights.py` to generate the tumor model data fit
    and weights plots.
* The deviations plot is generated via `scripts_deviation/plot.py`.
* The other scripts are just for intermediate results.
